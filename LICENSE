The files in this repo are based on Arduino code and Fritzing Files. Both of these communities play by don't be a jerk rules.

- Don't take credit for other people's work. Site your sources. (Attribute)
- Share because you were shared with. (Share Alike)
- Don't go make money off of someone else's work without giving back. That's just rude. (Non-Commercial or Commercial with Sharing)

Most of what I've put in this repo is pretty basic. You shouldn't feel weird about copying it, learning from it, deriving new projects from it, etc.  

You should consider sharing what you've done, too! I get it though, you're likely a beginner and that can be scary. No Worries. 

If you want to do things like publish the code or images in a book, base kits off the projects, that isn't Non-Commerical and directly in my field. We should talk.

ARDUINO NOTICE:
Open-source hardware shares much of the principles and approach of free and open-source software. In particular, we believe that people should be able to study our hardware to understand how it works, make changes to it, and share those changes. To facilitate this, we release all of the original design files (Eagle CAD) for the Arduino hardware. These files are licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license, which allows for both personal and commercial derivative works, as long as they credit Arduino and release their designs under the same license.
The Arduino software is also open-source. The source code for the Java environment is released under the GPL and the C/C++ microcontroller libraries are under the LGPL.


FRITZING NOTICE:
The source code of Fritzing is licensed under GNU GPL v3, the documentation and breadboard view graphics under CC Attribution-ShareALike.
You may re-publish our Fritzing documentation, as long as you attribute us, and publish it under CC-By-SA.
However, we do not allow the use of Fritzing part graphics in other software systems at the moment. If you think we should make an exception for you, please contact us.
